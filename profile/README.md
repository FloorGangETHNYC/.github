## Description

PEW is an new and innovative DAO governance system that solves the voting power inequality from current token-based governance systems by introducing an on-chain, reputation based score for voting power. Individuals have to self-declare their contributions to the DAO which are either vouched or refuted via Upvoting or downvoting respectively. The overall voting power an individual would have will be:

$A * Time\ Spent\ In\ DAO * B * Total\ Number\ Of\ Upvotes * C * Total\ Number\ Of\ Downvotes * D * Total\ Number\ Of\ Reviews\ Given$

where A, B, C, and D are customizable weights.

The framework that has been deployed easily allows new DAOs to be formed with a click of a button using a factory contract that deploys soulbound NFT collections.
